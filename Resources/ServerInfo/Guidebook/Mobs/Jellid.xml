  Jellids are a native species to the planet Trieste resides on. They were built to survive the deep sea and have trouble surviving on dry land.

  They have a naming scheme based off of stars and constallations, as they had never seen them prior to the Trieste settlers first contact and have grown to have a strong facination with space.
  ex. Regulus, Centauri, Sirius, Betelgeuse, Orion

  ## Breathing

  Jellids need to breathe water to keep their membrane's osmosis stable, or else they bleed their seawater out and rip their membrane.

  They are, however, immune to the ocean's extreme cold and pressure, making them adept expeditioneers.

  ## Power

  Jellids do not eat, nor do they drink. Instead, they have large energy stores that directly convert charged electrons into an energy source. 
  They do this by siphoning the electrons from power containing objects such as: power cells, stun batons or disablers.
  If they run out of energy, they will die rapidly. They have an estimated 15 minutes of energy before this happens.

  ## First contact

  Jellids were first discovered when Trieste settlers first came to the abandoned Sweetwater complex, finding it in disrepair and overrun with algae. The first explorers found a native Jellid colony living inside, siphoning the spare energy from the long unpowered SMES and cables.
  They were given universal translators, and specialized breathing packs to allow them to enter dry land and join the settlement. In exchange, they assisted with the renovations of Sweetwater and helped locate the Artifact due to their innate taste for energy.
